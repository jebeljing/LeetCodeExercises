 * Created by jingshanyin on 1/8/17.
 * 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST.
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

 Note:
 You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

 Follow up:
 What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

 Hint:

 Try to utilize the property of a BST.
 What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
 The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
